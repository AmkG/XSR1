<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the elite unit of the Iratan Starship Fleet &mdash;
the Iratan Star Riders.
Although you may have several thousand hours of flight time &mdash;
there <em>are</em>, after all, minimum requirements &mdash;
before you can be allowed to pilot
an actual Star Rider elite domination fighter,
you must first engage in this
high-accuracy simulation,
the <abbr title="Evaluation Machine, Star Rider, revision 1">XSR1</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
In the simulated mission,
a hypothetical galactic empire,
the Nyloz Regime,
has broken its treaty with the Irata Federation.
Technically, there is a state of war
between the Nyloz Regime
and the Irata Federation.
The menace of the Nyloz Regime
threatens to eliminate
all human colonies in the galaxy.
</p>
<p>
Your orders:
Eliminate the Nyloz threat
using a sole Star Rider domination fighter.
In order to pass this evaluation,
you must be able to achieve the rank
"Star Commander Class 1"
at the "Commander" mission level.
</p>
<h2>Nyloz Empire Information</h2>
<p>
The simulation includes three major classes
of Nyloz craft:
</p>
<ol>
<!-- TODO: get images. -->
<li>Nyloz Fighter &ndash;
fast and aggressive, deadly at close range.</li>
<li>Nyloz Cruiser &ndash;
these avoid close combat, but are tough oponents when approached.</li>
<li>Nyloz Basestar &ndash;
top-of-the-line craft, combining speed and aggression of Nyloz Fighters
with shields exceeding that of Nyloz Cruisers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The Nyloz will avoid contact unless you enter a sector
with Nyloz ships.
While you are engaged with a Nyloz force,
the rest of the Nyloz navy will surround and destroy Irata starbases,
which are your military support base.
</p>
<p>
During combat you will be concerned only with the Nyloz craft
occupying the sector you're currently in.
You have the capability to "hyperwarp" to any sector
at any time.
Any Nyloz craft you destroy will remain destroyed
for the remainder of the simulation. 
</p>
<h2>Ship Information</h2>
<p>
The Star Rider domination fighter has an improved version
of standard repulser shields,
capable of greatly reducing damage done by
standard photon missiles.
The Star Rider also has two photon torpedo tubes,
each capable of fore and aft firing directions.
</p>
<p>
Each Star Rider has Twin Pulsed-Ion Engines with
Afterburner capability.
Afterburners are automatically engaged
when travelling above
the rated cruise speed of 12 metrons per second.
</p>
<p>
Star Riders integrate full hyperwarp capability
with Distributed Hyperwarp Struts.
These hyperwarp struts are part of the basic core
and structure of the ship.
Unlike most craft,
Star Riders cannot lose hyperwarp functionality
unless the whole ship is destroyed.
The drawback is that loss of energy
is sufficient condition
to cause misalignment of hyperwarp struts
and destruction of the fighter,
so always ensure that your fighter
has sufficient energy for continued operation.
</p>
<p>
Star Riders use standard docking protocols for starbases.
Star Riders use a module system
that allows complete replacement
of damaged modules,
greatly reducing time needed
to replenish energy
and repair fighter components.
</p>
<h2>Simulation Information</h2>
<p>
The <abbr title="Evaluation Machine, Star Rider, revision 1">XSR1</abbr>
simulation has four mission levels:
</p>
<!-- TODO: images for difficulty levels -->
<ol>
<li><strong>NOVICE</strong> &ndash;
3 starbases to protect,
eliminate 27 Nyloz ships,
shields cannot be damaged or destroyed,
hyperwarp auto-tracking enabled.</li>
<li><strong>PILOT</strong> &ndash;
4 starbases to protect,
eliminate 36 Nyloz ships.
At <strong>PILOT</strong> level and above,
shields can be damaged or destroyed,
and hyperwarp must be tracked manually.</li>
<li><strong>WARRIOR</strong> &ndash;
5 starbases to protect,
eliminate 45 Nyloz ships.</li>
<li><strong>COMMAND</strong> &ndash;
6 starbases to protect,
eliminate 54 Nyloz ships.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Primarily, your mission is to destroy all Nyloz starships.
Do not allow them to destroy your fighter, and reduce
the damage done to your craft.
Secondarily, complete your mission in as little time as possible,
with minimal energy usage,
and without letting Iratan starbases to be destroyed.
