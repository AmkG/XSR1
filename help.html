<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the elite unit of the Iratan Starship Fleet &mdash;
the Iratan Star Riders.
Although you may have several thousand hours of flight time &mdash;
there <em>are</em>, after all, minimum requirements &mdash;
before you can be allowed to pilot
an actual Star Rider elite domination fighter,
you must first engage in this
high-accuracy simulation,
the <abbr title="Evaluation Machine, Star Rider, revision 1">XSR1</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
In the simulated mission,
a hypothetical galactic empire,
the Nyloz Regime,
has broken its treaty with the Irata Federation.
Technically, there is a state of war
between the Nyloz Regime
and the Irata Federation.
The menace of the Nyloz Regime
threatens to eliminate
all human colonies in the galaxy.
</p>
<p>
Your orders:
Eliminate the Nyloz threat
using a sole Star Rider domination fighter.
In order to pass this evaluation,
you must be able to achieve the rank
"Star Commander Class 1"
at the "Commander" mission level.
</p>
<h2>Nyloz Empire Information</h2>
<p>
The simulation includes three major classes
of Nyloz craft:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Nyloz Fighter &ndash;
fast and aggressive, deadly at close range.</li>
<li>Nyloz Cruiser &ndash;
these avoid close combat, but are tough oponents when approached.</li>
<li>Nyloz Basestar &ndash;
top-of-the-line craft, combining speed and aggression of Nyloz Fighters
with shields exceeding that of Nyloz Cruisers.</li>
</ol></p>

      <div class=title>Nyloz Basestar</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
The Nyloz will avoid contact unless you enter a sector
with Nyloz ships.
While you are engaged with a Nyloz force,
the rest of the Nyloz navy will surround and destroy Irata starbases,
which are your military support base.
</p>
<p>
During combat you will be concerned only with the Nyloz craft
occupying the sector you're currently in.
You have the capability to "hyperwarp" to any sector
at any time.
Any Nyloz craft you destroy will remain destroyed
for the remainder of the simulation. 
</p>
<h2>Ship Information</h2>
<p>
The Star Rider domination fighter has an improved version
of standard repulser shields,
capable of greatly reducing damage done by
standard photon missiles.
The Star Rider also has two photon torpedo tubes,
each capable of fore and aft firing directions.
</p>
<p>
Each Star Rider has Twin Pulsed-Ion Engines with
Afterburner capability.
Afterburners are automatically engaged
when travelling above
the rated cruise speed of 12 metrons per second.
</p>
<p>
Star Riders integrate full hyperwarp capability
with Distributed Hyperwarp Struts.
These hyperwarp struts are part of the basic core
and structure of the ship.
Unlike most craft,
Star Riders cannot lose hyperwarp functionality
unless the whole ship is destroyed.
The drawback is that loss of energy
is sufficient condition
to cause misalignment of hyperwarp struts
and destruction of the fighter,
so always ensure that your fighter
has sufficient energy for continued operation.
</p>
<p>
Star Riders use standard docking protocols for starbases.
Star Riders use a module system
that allows complete replacement
of damaged modules,
greatly reducing time needed
to replenish energy
and repair fighter components.
Starbases, on recognizing your fighter,
will automatically dispatch a repair bot
carrying all modules of your ship.
</p>
<h2>Simulation Information</h2>
<p>
The <abbr title="Evaluation Machine, Star Rider, revision 1">XSR1</abbr>
simulation has four mission levels:
</p>
<!-- TODO: images for difficulty levels -->
<ol>
<li><strong>NOVICE</strong> &ndash;
3 starbases to protect,
eliminate 27 Nyloz ships,
shields cannot be damaged or destroyed,
hyperwarp auto-tracking enabled.</li>
<li><strong>PILOT</strong> &ndash;
4 starbases to protect,
eliminate 36 Nyloz ships.
At <strong>PILOT</strong> level and above,
shields can be damaged or destroyed,
and hyperwarp must be tracked manually.</li>
<li><strong>WARRIOR</strong> &ndash;
5 starbases to protect,
eliminate 45 Nyloz ships.</li>
<li><strong>COMMANDER</strong> &ndash;
6 starbases to protect,
eliminate 54 Nyloz ships.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Primarily, your mission is to destroy all Nyloz starships.
Do not allow them to destroy your fighter,
and minimize
the damage done to your craft.
Secondarily, complete your mission in as little time as possible,
with minimal energy usage,
and without letting Iratan starbases to be destroyed.
</p>
</section>

<section id='directioncontrol' name='directioncontrol'>
<h1>Direction Control</h1>
<p>
On a standard keyboard,
the arrow keys are mapped
to the Star Rider's
Direction Control Pad.
Ensure that your keyboard is positioned
such that access to these keys
is comfortable and natural.
</p>
<h2>Direction Control Pad</h2>
<p>
In keeping with official fleet jargon,
your keyboard's arrow keys
will henceforth be referred to
as the
<strong><dfn id='dfn-directioncontrol'>Direction Control Pad</dfn></strong>.
Pressing the up button on the
<strong>Direction Control Pad</strong>
causes your Star Rider to dive,
while pressing the down button
causes your Star Rider to climb.
Pressing the left button
turns your ship to port
(left side of the ship facing forward).
Pressing the right button
turns your ship to starboard
(right side of the ship facing forward).
</p>
<!-- TODO: some kind of example indicator -->
<p>These directions apply to
the <strong>front view</strong> of the ship.
When using the <strong>aft</strong> view,
directions are reversed.
</p>
</section>

<section id='controls' name='controls'>
<h1>Control Keys</h1>
<p>
The Star Rider controls are mapped
onto a standard keyboard.
These controls mimic the operation and location
of actual control buttons on a Star Rider fighter.

<p>
In addition, the <strong>space bar</strong> serves
as your Photon fire button.
Holding the <strong>space bar</strong> down
causes your simulated Star Rider to fire
at maximum rate.
</p>

<h2 id='enginecontrol'>Twin Pulsed-Ion Engines Control (0-9)</h2>
<p>
The Twin Pulsed-Ion engines are used
to maneuver your Star Rider within a sector
while pursuing or evading the enemy.
Use these keys to select the velocity or speed
at which your domination fighter travels.
The corresponding speed is displayed
as the <strong>V:</strong> indicator on your panel.
</p>
<p>
Your ship always moves forward.
The optimum cruise speed is key 6 (V: 12).
Nyloz starships have a maximum speed slightly less than 7 (V: 25).

<h2 id='aftview'>Aft View (A)</h2>
<p>Shows view of space behind your fighter.
When in this view, photons are fired backwards.</p>

<h2 id='attackcomputer'>Attack Computer Enable/Disable (C)</h2>
<p>
Enables or disables the Attack Computer.
The Attack Computer projects crosshairs in the Fore and Aft View.
It also predicts the approximate visible location of objects
beyond normal human viewing range,
and projects a spinning cursor in the predicted location.
</p>
<p>
Whether or not the Attack Computer is enabled,
your on-board Instruments Computer will update
the vertical (<strong>&theta;:</strong>),
the horizontal (<strong>&Phi;:</strong>),
and the range (<strong>R:</strong>)
indicators on your panel
to match the readings from your instruments.
These indicate the position of attacking Nyloz starships
and allied starbases in the same sector
relative to your Star Rider.
</p>
<h2 id='frontview'>Front View (F)</h2>
<p>Shows view of space in front of your fighter.</p>
<h2 id='galacticchart'>Galactic Chart View (G)</h2>
<p>
The Galactic Chart is a vital tool
in your mission.
It gives you an overview of the sectors
in the relevant octant of the galaxy
under threat of Nyloz invasion.
Sectors may contain a Nyloz starship group,
a friendly allied Iratan starbase,
or nothing at all.
</p>
<!-- TODO: Image for Galactic Chart. -->
<p>
On the Galactic Chart,
sectors with <strong>&diams;</strong>
contain a friendly starbase
where you can dock
to repair and refuel your fighter.
Sectors with lines contain a number of
Nyloz starships.
</p>
<p>
There are also two yellow dots
on the Galactic Chart.
One of these indicates your current position,
while the other dot
(which you can control via the Direction Control Pad)
indicates your hyperwarp target.
</p>
<p>
To travel to another sector,
move the hyperwarp target dot
to the target sector
and then <a href='#hyperwarp'>"hyperwarp"</a> into that sector.
</p>
<p>
It is vital to your mission to frequently check the Galactic Chart.
It not only indicates the progress of your mission
to eliminate the Nyloz threat,
it also shows enemy force movements.
The Nyloz will move around the octant
in an effort
to surround and destroy starbases.
Fortunately, the Nyloz will always focus
on only one starbase at a time.
They will not attempt to scatter to attack
multiple starbases.
</p>
<p>
Groups of Nyloz starships
move at different speeds
based on their size.
Groups of 1 or 2 ships move fastest.
Groups of 3 move at half that.
Groups of 4 move at approximately 1/8
the speed
of groups of 1 or 2.
</p>
<p>
When a starbase is surrounded,
you will receive a message
via your Sub-Space Radio.
You have about 2 minutes
(to be precise 150 centons)
to save the starbase.
A starbase is surrounded
if all 4 sectors directly beside it
have Nyloz starship groups.
</p>
<!-- TODO: example image of surrounded starbase. -->
<p>
To prevent destruction
of the allied Irata starbase,
you must clear
at least one sector beside it
of Nyloz starships.
</p>
<p>
It is imperative to <em>stop</em> the Nyloz
from destroying starbases.
If all starbases in the mission
have been destroyed,
you will be considered as having failed the mission.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the enemy disposition,
the Galactic Chart View
displays additional information.
As you move the hyperwarp target dot,
the amount of energy needed to hyperwarp
is displayed by the
<strong>WARP ENERGY:</strong> indicator.
In addition, the number of enemy targets
that occupy the target sector is displayed
by the <strong>TARGETS:</strong> indicator.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>STAR DATE:</strong> indicator
shows the elapsed time during a mission.
It is based on units called centons.
The Nyloz will only move
on a <strong>STAR DATE:</strong>
ending in .50 or .00.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is the damage control or
<strong>DC:</strong> indicator.
It's shown as <strong>DC:PESCLR</strong>.
Each letter corresponds
to various components
of your ship.
</p>
<!-- TODO: image of damage control -->
<p><table class=keycontrol>

</table></p>
<p>
The status of each component is defined
by the color of its letter.
A green letter indicates a fully working component.
A yellow letter indicates a damaged component
while a red letter indicates a completely destroyed component.
</p>
<p>
The engines will still work even after they have been destroyed
thanks to a backup pseudo-pulse system,
although progress will be very slow.
The shields will flicker when damaged,
and if you are hit by Nyloz photons
while the shield happens to have flickered off,
your fighter will be destroyed.
When the computer is damaged,
coordinate information
<strong>&theta;:</strong>, <strong>&Phi;:</strong>, and <strong>R:</strong>
is not updated.
When the computer is destroyed,
no computer functions
will operate.
If the Long-Range Scan is damaged,
it will show a mirrored image in addition
to the normal image of the sector scan
(see the section on <a href='#longrangescan'>Long-Range Scan</a>).
</p>

<h2 id='hyperwarp'>Hyperwarp Engines Engage/Disengage (H)</h2>
<p>
You must engage hyperwarp in order to move
from one sector to another.
First, switch to the <a href='#galacticchart'>Galactic Chart View</a>
and use the Direction Control Pad
to move your hyperwarp target cursor
to the desired sector.
Then turn to the <a href='#frontview'>Fore View</a>
and engage hyperwarp by pressing the 'H' key.
</p>
<p>
In <strong>NOVICE</strong> level,
there is no need to steer while in hyperwarp.
However,
in <strong>PILOT</strong>, <strong>WARRIOR</strong>,
and <strong>COMMANDER</strong> levels,
you must steer in hyperwarp.
When hyperwarp is engaged,
a hyperwarp target marker is displayed
on your front view.
</p>
<!-- TODO: hyperwarp marker -->
<p>
Use the Direction Control Pad
to keep the hyperwarp target marker centered
as closely as possible.
Enabling the Attack Computer
will assist you greatly
in determining the center.
If you get too far out of alignment,
you will end up in the wrong sector.
</p>
<p>
A red warning will be displayed
if you enter a sector
with enemy Nyloz starships.
</p>
<p>
The closer your cursor is to the center,
the closer you will be to your target sector.
You can abort hyperwarp
by pressing any of the Engine control keys
or by pressing 'H' again.
</p>
<p>
As hyperwarp will accelerate you into hyperspace,
it can be used as a quick escape
in emergencies
as well as for travel through normal space
if your main engines are destroyed.
</p>

<h2 id='longrangescan'>Long-Range Scan View (L)</h2>
<p>
Shows you a top view of the sector
you are currently in.
Your Star Rider fighter
will be located in the center
and all other objects in the sector
rotate around it.
Any Nyloz starships or starbases
will be identified and appear
in the Long-Range Scan.
</p>
<p>
A simple way to use the Long-Range Scan is:
</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Select a target.</li>
  <li>Push the Direction Control Pad's left button
      (which causes all objects to rotate around you)
      until the target is directly in front of your fighter.</li>
  <li>Push the Direction Control Pad's up or down button
      so that the target is as far away from you as possible.
      Which you should press (up or down) depends on which one
      moves the target away from you.</li>
  <li>Use the engines to approach the target.</li>
  <li>Stop and make course corrections as you approach
      your target.
      Repeat steps 2 to 4 if necessary.</li>
  <li>When the target is close to your ship, stop the engines.
      The target should now be visible in the front view.</li>
</ol></p>
<!-- TODO: LRS example -->
<p>
If you cannot find the target on the Long-Range Scan at all,
and you know the target is immobile
in the sector
(for example a starbase or an evading Nyloz ship),
use the following procedure:
</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Push the Direction Control Pad's down button
      until you've performed a 180-degree turn,
      or you've located the target
      on the Long-Range Scan.
      Use the stars as a guide to how much you've turned.</li>
  <li>Push the Direction Control Pad's left button
      until you've performed a 90-degree turn.
      Again, use the stars as a guide.
      If a star is to your ship's right, for example,
      you know you've made a 90-degree turn if it ends up
      behind you.
      Try to make a precise 90-degree turn here.</li>
  <li>Push the Direction Control Pad's down button again,
      and make another 180-degree turn.
      The target should appear on this turn if it didn't
      already appear in the previous turnings.</li>
  <li>Once you've located the target,
      perform the previous procedure to approach it.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
When the Long-Range Scan
is damaged (but not destroyed),
then you will also see a mirror image
of everything scanned
in the sector.
One object will be a reflection.
Select one image and attempt to move towards it.
If it instead moves away from you,
you have chosen the reflection
instead of the actual target
and should turn around.
</p>
<!-- TODO: Damaged LRS example -->

<h2 id='manualtargetswitching'>Manual Target Switching (M)</h2>
<p>
Generally, up to two Nyloz will attack at one time.
They are designated as targets 0 and 1,
displayed as <strong>T:0</strong> and <strong>T:1</strong>
on the panel.
The computer will default to targeting <strong>T:0</strong>
until you eliminate it,
then switch to <strong>T:1</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the 'M' key lets you switch between targets manually.
</p>
<p>
Damage to your computer may prevent it
from switching targets automatically.
You will need to use the manual switching
in that case.
</p>
<p>
When tracking a friendly starbase,
it is counted as <strong>T:0</strong>.
</p>
<!-- TODO: example of why manual switching is sometimes good -->

<h2 id='shields'>Shield Enable/Disable (S)</h2>
<p>
The Star Rider's Shield protects the fighter from destruction.
When enabled, there will be a bluish tint to space.
When disabled, space will be the normal black.
The Star Rider will be destroyed by Nyloz photons
if hit while the Shield is down.
</p>
<p>
The Shield does not perfectly protect the fighter
from <em>all</em> damage.
Ship components may still be damaged by incoming enemy fire.
As the Shield itself is a component of the ship,
this means you can still be destroyed in two hits:
one to disable your shield,
the second to destroy you.
Avoid or shoot down incoming enemy missiles!
</p>

<h2 id='tracking'>Auto-Tracking Enable/Disable (T)</h2>
<p>
When Auto-Tracking is enabled,
your computer will automatically track
the current target
when it moves from behind you to in front of you,
and vice versa,
and switches automatically
between Fore View and Aft View
as appropriate.
This is useful in higher difficulty levels,
as the Nyloz can attack you from behind.
</p>
<p>
Note however that it is possible to be caught in a cross-fire
with one Nyloz in front of you and another behind you.
The Nyloz can then fire alternately,
and the computer will automatically re-target
the enemy starship that most recently fired.
This can cause rapid switches in view.
</p>
<p>
Despite the above problem,
many ace Star Rider pilots swear by Auto-Tracking.
A particularly vocal few, however,
have managed to achieve high kill rates
even with Auto-Tracking disabled.
It is thus kept as an option that may be enabled or disabled
at the pilot's discretion.
</p>
<p>
Auto-Tracking starts out disabled.
If you depend on it,
remember to turn it on at the start of each mission.
</p>
<p>
Damage to the computer may prevent Auto-Tracking
from working.
You will then need to manually switch between
Aft View and Fore View.
</p>

<h2 id='pause'>Pause (P/Esc)</h2>
<p>
Pauses the simulation.
A small menu is shown,
which allows you to resume the simulation
or return to the difficulty level selection.
</p>

<h2 id='controlpanel'>Control Panel Display</h2>
<!-- TODO: image of control panel -->
<p>
The control panel display,
visible in the Fore View, Aft View, and Long-Range Scan View,

</table></p>

<h2 id=subspaceradio>Sub-Space Radio</h2>
<p>
The Sub-Space Radio is the ship component
that keeps your Galactic Chart up-to-date.
When you select the Galactic Chart View,
the Sub-Space Radio is automatically enabled
to get the latest information
on enemy ship movements.
It is otherwise a passive component
capable only of receiving high-power broadcast messages,
particularly "STARBASE SURROUNDED" and "STARBASE DESTROYED" messages.
</p>
<p>
If the Sub-Space Radio is damaged,
the Galactic Chart cannot be updated,
but it is still possible to receive broadcast messages
as well as make specific queries
about the contents of specific sectors
(i.e. the <strong>TARGETS:</strong> indicator will still work).
However if the Sub-Space Radio is destroyed,
no communications is possible.
</p>
</section>

<section id='starbasedocking' name='starbasedocking'>
<h1>Docking With Starbases</h1>
<p>
Starbases are your military support
in addition to being assets under your protection.
During your mission,
you may dock at any starbase
at any time
to repair and refuel your fighter.
</p>
<p>
In order to initiate docking,
you must have the starbase centered in front of you
with a range <strong>R:</strong> indicator
of less than +006,
and with engines stopped completely
(engine key 0).
</p>
<p>
Once docking is initiated,
the starbase will dispatch
a repair bot
containing fresh Star Rider modular components
and a full supply of energy.
This repair bot is programmed
to approach a fixed location only,
so moving will abort the docking process.
</p>
<!-- TODO: Image of docked starbase -->
<p>
Below is a general procedure for initiating docking.
As you are likely to need docking if your fighter is damaged,
make sure to also practice this procedure with Attack Computer off
and using only the Long-Range Scan.
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Locate the starbase using your Attack Computer
    or Long-Range Scan so that it is directly
    in front of you.</li>
<li>If the starbase is not within sight
    (range <strong>R:</strong> is greater than +120)
    set engines to key 6 (<strong>V:12</strong>)
    until the starbase comes into range.
    Make any needed course corrections
    especially if you are using the Long-Range Scan
    to locate the starbase.</li>
<li>When the starbase is just within sight,
    drop your speed to engines key 5 (<strong>V:06</strong>)
    for easier navigation.
    Make any needed course corrections
    to ensure the starbase is centered.</li>
<li>As you approach the starbase,
    drop your engines to key 3 or 4.  </li>
<li>When the starbase is very near,
    drop your engines to key 1 or 2
    until your range is within <strong>R:+006</strong>
    or less.</li>
<li>Stop engines (engine key 0) and wait
    to be repaired and refueled.</li>
</ol></p>
</section>

<section id='energy' name='energy'>
<h1>Energy Consumption Rates</h1>
<p>
In addition to being judged by your mission completion speed,
number of surviving starbases,
and mission difficulty level,
you are judged according to your energy usage
during the mission.
</p>
<p>
Turning off components
(such as turning off the Shield in a starbase or empty sector,
or turning off the Attack Computer while docked
or not attacking the Nyloz)
is part of the standard strategy employed
by ace Star Rider pilots
to conserve energy.
In addition,
avoiding or shooting down incoming photons
helps reduce energy consumption,
since being hit with the Shield enabled
drains your energy.
</p>
<p>
Some passive energy consumption is needed
for life support
and for maintaining the alignment
of the Distributed Hyperwarp Struts.
Loss of energy equates to destruction of the fighter,
as misalignment of the struts
will destroy the fighter's skeleton.

<h1>Tips by Ace Pilots</h1>
<h2 id=tipphotons>Photons</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>Remember that you have two photon tubes!
    This gives you twice the firepower of a Nyloz ship.
    You can block incoming fire with one photon,
    then destroy the Nyloz with the next.
    Think of it as a left-right punch!</li>
<li>Photons, to some extent, can be steered after firing.
    Turning your ship will also turn the photons, slightly,
    in that direction.</li>
<li>Your photons have a range beyond your normal sight range.
    Use your Attack Computer to help you shoot
    the opponents you can't see.</li>
<li>The Nyloz can shoot at you
    before you even see them.
    So do the same to them:
    shoot <em>them</em> before they even see you!</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 id=tipengines>Engines</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>If your engines are shot out,
    your Hyperwarp can work as a burst-type engine.
    Just make short bursts of hyperwarp
    and make sure to abort before entering hyperspace.</li>
<li>The official manual says the best cruise speed
    is engines 6,
    but that's with Shield and Attack Computer off.
    I did the math,
    and if both Shield and Attack Computer are enabled,
    the faster engines 7 and 8 settings
    reduce the total energy spent
    to travel a fixed distance.</li>
<li>Keep travelling at engines 6,
    and some nasty Nyloz will bait you along,
    running at the same speed
    and keeping their distance
    far away from you
    until another Nyloz joins the attack behind you.
    Get to the higher speeds,
    you want to clear the sectors fast.</li>
<li>Once the Nyloz engage you,
    it's actually better for you
    to turn off your engines.
    So what if you're a literal sitting duck?
    Your Shield can take their fire
    and you got two photon tubes.
    The Nyloz like to sit beside you
    while you're cruising,
    only to swoop in for a surprise attack.
    Turn off the engines
    and <em>you'll</em> surprise <em>them</em>.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 id=tipshield>Shield</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>Like the fleet manual says,
    without the Shield,
    you're one shot away from death.
    And with the shield,
    you're, at worst, two shots away.
    Keep that in mind.
    See a photon?  Duck!</li>
<li>The Shield is powerful,
    but it's an energy hog.
    If you're safe and you know you're safe,
    turn it off.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for your Shield getting toasted!
    When that happens, Hyperwarp out immediately.
    Turn away from the enemies to make it harder
    for them to hit you,
    but don't turn your back on them completely
    or they'll hit you from behind.
    Just turn away quickly
    then get back on course
    when you've moved past your opponents.</li>
<li>Remembering that being hit
    with the Shield enabled
    loses you 100 energy,
    but shooting a photon
    to stop the incoming enemy photon
    will cost you only 10.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 id=tipcomputer>Computer</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>The numbers at the bottom of the panel
    indicate the position of your target.
    Learning to "fly by instrument"
    is important if your computer is damaged
    and your long-range scan is destroyed.</li>
<li>While very useful,
    the Attack Computer can only indicate one target
    at a time.
    It might not choose
    the <em>nearest</em> target.
    So remember to use the <strong>M</strong> key
    to quickly check distance to the possible targets.</li>
<li>Auto-tracking with the <strong>T</strong> key
    is a very important ability of the Star Rider.
    It saves you that vital fraction of a second
    to manually press <strong>F</strong> or <strong>A</strong> yourself.
    It can get mildly confusing in a tight firefight,
    but you practice can get you used to it.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2 id=tipchart>Galactic Chart</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>As you enter an enemy-occupied sector,
    you're moving too fast to be hit
    by Nyloz.
    Use this "grace period"
    to quickly bring up the chart
    and move your hyperwarp target
    to a nearby starbase.
    It can save you a few precious seconds
    when you quickly need
    to get out of a pinch!</li>
<li>While chasing down distant Nyloz,
    remember to quickly flash
    the Galactic Chart
    to update it.
    This is important in case
    your Sub-space Radio
    gets damaged in the subsequent fight.</li>
<li>When a base is surrounded and
    you've just cleared off one sector beside it,
    check if the nearby sectors have
    small, fast Nyloz groups.
    It may be better to stay in the cleared sector
    to keep the base from being surrounded <em>again</em>.
    Remember, the Nyloz won't engage you in combat!</li>
</ul></p>

<h1>History of the XSR1 Game</h1>
<p>
I pretty much inherited my father's Atari 800XL,
and started learning programming
on the excellent Atari Logo system.
I started programming maybe in 1993.
In addition, the Atari 800XL
was my main gaming computer,
and two of the best games I'd ever experienced
were the two Star Raider games;
the first Star Raider for gameplay,
the second for excellent graphics.
</p>
<p>
In around the early 21st century, sadly,
that Atari 800XL was on its last legs.
The Atari 1050 Floppy Disk Drive that came with it
was beginning to growl funny,
and the Atari 800XL's keyboard
was starting to not detect pressed keys.
Opening the machine
revealed that the flexible PCB
that was the keyboard's base
was beginning to oxidize and decay.
The guiderails for the 1050's disk head
were getting rusty.
In time, I would no longer be able
to actually utilize the machine
and its mechanical peripherals.
</p>
<p>
That's when I hit upon the rather amazing idea
to write an HTML+Javascript implementation
of the first Star Raider game.
</p>
<p>
(mind you,
this was before HTML5 was even a glimmer
in anyone's eye,
and hence no <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> &mdash;
and no fancy Star Raider II graphics)
</p>
<p>
So I opened my WinXP box
(I hadn't transitioned to a full GNU/Linux system
as yet then)
and started hacking together
<code>XSR1.html</code>.
As all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript
was in a single file,
it quickly became unwieldy.
I was able to implement the stars,
the engines,
the shield,
firing photons,
and starbase docking,
but not the enemies,
attack computer,
or the galactic chart.
This was some time in the early 2000's.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I lost interest in that particular implementation.
Sadly, I can no longer locate that version &mdash;
it is probably much more accurate to the original Star Raiders,
since I could still run and operate
the game on the Atari 800XL side-by-side
with the HTML+Javascript version
to compare.
</p>
<p>
Time passed,
and while Javascript didn't really change all that much,
attitudes toward it did change.
In particular,
the rise of <a class=extern href='http://nodejs.org/'>NodeJS</a>
and <a class=extern href='http://commonjs.org/'>CommonJS</a>
begat the Asynchronous Module Definition
(the foremost implementation
being <a class=extern href='http://requirejs.org/'>RequireJS</a>).
</p>
<p>
I'd always known that the main failing of <code>XSR1.html</code>
had been the lack of proper modularization
of the game.
Armed with RequireJS,
I reimplemented XSR1
into a holding HTML file,
a support CSS file,
and several Javascript files;
the version you are now playing today.
